# code-refactor

For this assignment, I refactored the code of a SEO website to make the CSS more concise and clean up the HTML. I also added the accessibility tags where appropriate and comments on both the CSS and HTML files.

## Deployment

Part of the assigment was to also deploy the website via GitHub which can be found [here](https://kelliekumasaka.github.io/code-refactor/).

## Content of Website

As you can see in the following pictures, nothing from the appearance should have been changed from the assignment parameters.

However, some classes in HTML and CSS were changed to make the code cleaner. 

## Summary

I have reorganized some of the code in different `classes` and made it more accessible with tags like `section`, `main`, etc. instead of `div`.
